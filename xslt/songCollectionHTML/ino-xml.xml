            <verse n="1">
                Can you feel the night?
                Would it be warm
                (It must be bright)
                Like a raging fire

        When the sky cries in April,
        the flowers and trees smile in May
        The time that passes tells me many lovely things
        But I can't feel it
        (Cut it out!)
        I flew high so that I could see everything
        (Cut it out!)
        I was on a roll
        I had to stop
        There is no up or down above the clouds
        And I can't breathe
        We're falling down.
        Slowly, like snow.
        Led by gravity
        Fading away in the warm glow
        Without resisting
        Let's take some strawberries and go to the hill
        If you want to see the fireworks, bring a cute scarf
        (The pictures in my head tell me a lot of stories)
        None of this is real
        (Cut it out!)
        I flew high so that I could see everything
        (Cut it out!)
        I was on a roll
        I had to stop
        There is no up or down above the clouds
        And I can't breathe
        We're falling down.
        Slowly, like snow.
        Led by gravity
        Fading away in the warm glow
        We lost the power to lose.
        By leaving all the pain
        Fading away in the warm glow
        We're falling down.
        Slowly, like snow.
        Led by gravity
        (Fading away in the warm glow)
        If I am to be swallowed by
        fate I must have fought well
        Praying that it will become a seed of (new life)
