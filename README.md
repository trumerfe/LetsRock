# LetsRock
In this project, our goal is to analize the character themes for every Guilty Gear -Strive- character, and relate the lyrics to their stories in the Guilty Gear lore.

Our resources to achieving this goal are mainly contained within the game's Wiki, https://guilty-gear.fandom.com/wiki/Guilty_Gear_Wiki and in cutscenes and dialogue found within the game itself.

The song lyrics are available in the Wiki, and the music can be found in-game, in several YouTube videos, and on Spotify and other On-Demand music services.
