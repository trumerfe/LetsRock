    <song name="Perfection Can't Please Me">





<lyrics>(Piping hot) Popping like popcorn
(It's all mine) Can you hear the bells ding dong
(This is it) (This is it)
If I could just see your heart, how small the world
It’s not that I don't want to know
Walking and stopping
Have a meaning, I guess so
What can I say, how many miles is life
Grab lots of snacks, and wear new shoes
How far can I go
I just want to feel like that everyday
(Piping hot) Popping like popcorn
(It's all mine) Can you hear the bells ding dong (Pick up every last one)
(This is it) (This is it) Ooh woah
(Let’s not) pretend I don't hear me
(Try to) move on without looking back
'Cause I realized it
Perfection can't please me
I didn't know that I could see the sky with my eyes closed,
And a moon to talk to
The world will spread everywhere,
If I want it to
Tell me more, how many miles is life
In the rainy streets, and having no umbrella
A time to be joyful
I just want to feel like that everyday
(Piping hot) Popping like popcorn
(It's all mine) Watch my soul bang bang (Pick up every last one)
(This is it) (This is it) Ooh woah
(Let's not) pretend I don’t hear me
(Try to) move on without looking back
'Cause I realized it
Perfection can't please me
How many miles is life
Grab lots of snacks, and wear new shoes
How far can I go
I just want to feel like that everyday
(Piping hot) Popping like popcorn
(It's all mine) Watch my soul bang bang (Pick up every last one)
(This is it) (This is it) Ooh yeah
(Let's not) pretend I don't hear me
(Try to) move on without looking back
(Piping hot) Cry and laugh
(It's all mine) Let you want those days
I guess it's not all fun and games
This journey is my own
I'm sorry if I bothered you
'Cause I realized it
Perfection can't please me
