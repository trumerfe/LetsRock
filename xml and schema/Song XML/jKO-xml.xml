<lyrics>
<chorus n="1">
<line n="1">(Piping hot) Popping like popcorn</line>
<line n="2">(It's all mine) Can you hear the bells ding dong</line>
<line n="3">(This is it) (This is it)</line>
</chorus>

<verse n="1">
<line n="1">If I could just see your heart, how small the world</line>
<line n="2">It’s not that I don't want to know</line>
<line n="3">Walking and stopping</line>
<line n="4">Have a meaning, I guess so</line>
<line n="5">What can I say, how many miles is life</line>
<line n="6">Grab lots of snacks, and wear new shoes</line>
<line n="7">How far can I go</line>
<line n="8">I just want to feel like that everyday</line>
</verse>

<chorus n="2">
<line n="1">(Piping hot) Popping like popcorn</line>
<line n="2">(It's all mine) Can you hear the bells ding dong (Pick up every last one)</line>
<line n="3">(This is it) (This is it) Ooh woah</line>
<line n="4">(Let’s not) pretend I don't hear me</line>
<line n="5">(Try to) move on without looking back</line>
<line n="6">'Cause I realized it</line>
<line n="7">Perfection can't please me</line>
</chorus>

<verse n="2">
<line n="1">I didn't know that I could see the sky with my eyes closed,</line>
<line n="2">And a moon to talk to</line>
<line n="3">The world will spread everywhere,</line>
<line n="4">If I want it to</line>
<line n="5">Tell me more, how many miles is life</line>
<line n="6">In the rainy streets, and having no umbrella</line>
<line n="7">A time to be joyful</line>
<line n="8">I just want to feel like that everyday</line>
</verse>

<chorus n="3">
<line n="1">(Piping hot) Popping like popcorn</line>
<line n="2">(It's all mine) Watch my soul bang bang (Pick up every last one)</line>
<line n="3">(This is it) (This is it) Ooh woah</line>
<line n="4">(Let's not) pretend I don’t hear me</line>
<line n="5">(Try to) move on without looking back</line>
<line n="6">'Cause I realized it</line>
<line n="7">Perfection can't please me</line>
</chorus>

<bridge n="1">
<line n="1">How many miles is life</line>
<line n="2">Grab lots of snacks, and wear new shoes</line>
<line n="3">How far can I go</line>
<line n="4">I just want to feel like that everyday</line>
</bridge>

<chorus n="4">
<line n="1">(Piping hot) Popping like popcorn</line>
<line n="2">(It's all mine) Watch my soul bang bang (Pick up every last one)</line>
<line n="3">(This is it) (This is it) Ooh yeah</line>
<line n="4">(Let's not) pretend I don't hear me</line>
<line n="5">(Try to) move on without looking back</line>
<line n="6">(Piping hot) Cry and laugh</line>
<line n="7">(It's all mine) Let you want those days</line>
<line n="8">I guess it's not all fun and games</line>
<line n="9">This journey is my own</line>
<line n="10">I'm sorry if I bothered you</line>
<line n="11">'Cause I realized it</line>
<line n="12">Perfection can't please me</line>
