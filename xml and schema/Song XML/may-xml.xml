    No matter how big it is,
    its time will come
    It will be reborn as something new
    The full moon
    Bright balloons
    Only my feelings will ever grow
    
    <parentheses>(An off-season)</parentheses>
    Swallow. So that's me
    Non-stop love song
    <parentheses>(I will)</parentheses> follow you,
    wherever you go
    I can't wait to
    catch up
    Before the sun sleeps
    Not if you're short of breath
    I'm The Disaster of Passion
    All you need to know is one or two things, or a few
    I'm alone, but I'm not alone
    You know that, right?
    Trees and Rain
    Now and then
    I can't live without that precious one
    
    <parentheses>(An off-season)</parentheses>
    Swallow. So that's me
    springtime syndrome
    <parentheses>(I will)</parentheses> follow you,
    wherever you go
    I can't wait to
    catch up
    Before the sun sleeps
    Not if you're short of breath
    Just so you know, please don't think you're
    going to get away with it. Okay?
    
    The sun shine,
    The breeze's song
    
    <parentheses>(An off-season)</parentheses>
    Swallow. So that's me
    Non-stop love song
    <parentheses>(I will)</parentheses> follow you,
    wherever you go
    I can't wait to
    catch up
    Before the sun sleeps
    Not if you're short of breath
    I'm The Disaster of Passion
