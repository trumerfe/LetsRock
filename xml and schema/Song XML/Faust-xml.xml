VOID!
Shit attacking from the other side
YUCK! Alone Infection
Chaos! ABCDEF GO
Checkmate (checkmate) informed consent (oh yeah)
It increases words
Relation (relation) duration (oh yeah)
Build and realize

Messiah
Will not come
Parallax! Paradox!
Paradigm will attack

We've got only one sky
Blue, red, and black paranoia
What is it like to you?
No one can see the colors but you

Alone Infection
VOID!
Shit attacking from the other side
YUCK! Alone Infection
Chaos! ABCDEF GO!
Light and (darkness) invisible (oh yeah)
Your soul dissipates
Destruction (destruction) reduction (oh yeah)
Tower of Babel

Messiah
Will not come
Parallax! Paradox!
Paradigm will attack
We've got only one sky
Blue, red, and black paranoia
What is it like to you?
No one can see the colors but you

I had to run away from here
Before the storm hit
We see eye to eye
We see eye to eye
I told me without you
We've got only one sky
Blue, red, and black paranoia
What is it like to you?
No one can see the colors but you

We've got only one sky
Joy, grief, fun paranoia
What is it like to you?
No one can see the colors
the colors but you
