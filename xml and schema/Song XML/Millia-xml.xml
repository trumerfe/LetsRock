                So carry on, love the subhuman self
                Time goes on, lasting road
                I left my regret
                So carry on, love the subhuman self
                Time goes on, lasting road
                (But) I feel a touch of moonlight

            <verse n="2">
                I swept you off your feet... - (She told me)
                We know deep down - There's no way
                Throwing rocks into the lake - (The Bee's Knees)
                How do we look? (Letdown)
