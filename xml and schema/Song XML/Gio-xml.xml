Goodbye.
Never will I see 'em again
Nor would they want me to
Stop beating around the bush.
OK. I'm OK!!
But I guess that's just me
Nobody is to blame for my fate
I do I, don't be fake.
Keep it real.
Keep it real.
I do I, get a good vibe.
Keep it real.
Keep it real.
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not going to hate myself.
There's not point in holdin' a grudge about something
All of my choices.
I could've quit.
I'm just a cold metal.
I do I, don't be fake.
Keep it real.
Keep it real.
I do I, get a good vibe.
Keep it real.
Keep it real.
I wanna just be a trigger with a brutish impulse,
Trigger
The Silent Preacher
Watch out. Keep your hands off. Don't make a big deal out of me.
Trigger.
Don't be curious about me
I don't want you to get hurt.
Watch out. Keep your hands off. Don't make a big deal out of me.
Never mind.
I'm dirty...
Splash splash splash.
Goodbye.
Never will I see 'em again
Nor would they want me to
Stop beating around the bush.
OK.
I'm OK!!
But I guess that's just me
Nobody is to blame for my fate
I do I, don't be fake.
Keep it real.
Keep it real.
I do I, get a good vibe.
You know, some beasts don't live in herds
Just like that
I don't need your sympathy
Trigger with a brutish impulse.
Trigger
The Silent Preacher
Watch out. Keep your hands off. Don't make a big deal out of me.
Trigger.
Don't be curious about me.
I don't want you to get hurt. Watch out. Keep your hands off. Don't make a big deal out of me.
