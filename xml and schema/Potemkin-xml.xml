I know nothing
I may sound like a silly clown
But I won't turn my back on life
One day, all will rot away
(But) All. I. Do. Is. Embrace, the, wounded, soul!
        </p>
Armor-clad Faith!
Cruel Inequality
(Paves way for our future)
A black and grey system
Always dressed to impress
People drown in delusion
Without reaching out for truth
(With) thorned shield in the hand the troops
MARCH TO OPPRESS THE YOUTH!
Nirvana
Discord - Presides
In society - Your society
Vantege - Creeps into
Society - Your society
I'm a fool, I know nothing
I take the role of a silly clown
But I won't turn my back on life
One day, all will rot away
(But) All. I. Do. Is. Embrace, the, wounded, soul!
Discord - Presides
In society - Your society
Vantage - Creeps into
Society - Your society
I'm a fool, I know nothing
I take the role of a silly clown
But I won't turn my back on life
I'm a fool, maybe I'm worthless
But this world created my faith
So all I can do is stay hopeful and pray
