        <h2 class="center">Millia Rage</h2>
        <p>Born in Russia, she too was orphaned by the crusades and raised by the Assassin's Guild, like her eventual lover Zato-1. Like Zato-1, she would learn one of the guild's forbidden techniques and have the power to manipulate her hair as a weapon. Eventually, she feared her fate as a member of the guild and agreed to the International Federation Police to betray Zato-1 in exchange for her acquittal in being part of the guild. She would eventually have a final confrontation with Zato-1 as he died and Eddie took over, till his eventual death as well. She would then live a few years, finally free of the guild.
        </p>
        <p>When Zato-1 and Eddie are revived by the conclave, she goes to investigate and finds Venom there too. The 3 reunite and all seems to be mostly peaceful between them after making amends years ago with Zatoâ€™s initial death. The three help fight against the Universal Will along with the others. She, alongside Zato-1, go to the White House to help aid against Happy Chaos. After the defeat of I-No and Happy Chaos, she joins Zato-1 to go visit the now-retired Venom at his bakery.</p>
