        <h2 class="center">Faust</h2>
        <p> A mysterious doctor who has lived a mysterious life. Once known as the famous Dr.Baldhead, he was driven mad over the death of a young patient in his own hands. Driven to a rage over his apparent fault, he became a serial killer, until one day it was revealed it was actually a murder and the blame was pinned on him. To atone for his sins, he threw away that life and became Faust, an eccentric yet loving doctor once more. In recent times however, he is now but a shambling, scar stricken, corpse like shell of his former self with no explanation as to his condition.</p>
