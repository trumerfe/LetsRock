        <h2 class="center">Potemkin</h2>
        <p>Born in the military state of Zepp, he would grow up to join the numerous slave soldiers sent out on deadly missions. Due to his mutation of inhuman strength and size, he was seen as a useful asset to the plans of the brutal nation. After the revolution of the fascist nation, led by Sgt. Gabriel, would go on to free all slaves, including Potemkin. Following his freedom, he would continue to serve Gabriel to ensure the safety of the world as he is sent to carry out missions for good as opposed to military gain.  </p>
        <p>
            Over the years he would be sent out to carry different important missions such as trying to protect and escort the daughter of Justice: Dizzy, interfering with Ramlethal's attack on the world, and currently preventing further damage from Happy Chaos' plan. Following his defeat, he was awarded by Gabriel for his many endeavors.
