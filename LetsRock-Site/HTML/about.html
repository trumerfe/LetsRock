        <h2 class="center">About The Project</h2>
        <p>We have strived to make a great site that would analyze the lyrics of each character in the great fighting game of Guilty Gear Strive. Each character's theme song has traits referring to their in game history and background and with our site we hope to document it to our best capabilities.</p>
        <p>The Guilty Gear franchise is one that has been on going for over 20 years now, and in the newset entry Guilty Gear Strive, many characters and plotlines come to an end as the mysterious figure Happy Chaos begins his unkown plan that could change the very world itself.</p>
